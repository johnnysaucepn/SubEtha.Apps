This is a set of .NET Core apps that use the [SubEtha libraries](https://github.com/johnnysaucepn/SubEtha) for parsing and consuming Elite: Dangerous Player's Journal log
events and key bindings.

These make use of a set of additional libraries (called *Howatworks.Thumb*) that offer some useful capabilities for getting started in making tools.

### Howatworks.Matrix and Howatworks.Assistant

These working applications use the libraries to illustrate some of the possibilities.

*Matrix* watches for certain status changes of ships and locations, and submits them to a central ASP.NET Core server - this allows groups of ships to be monitored in
real-time.

*Assistant* operates as a virtual control panel - by checking for controls bound to keys, it can provide a Websocket-powered web front-end to ship operations. In addition,
since it also monitors journal events, it can dynamically switch control options according to the situation.

**See README files in each application's source folder for more information**
